* [iOS Dev Weekly] - Weekly newsletter (probably the most popular one) about iOS development.
* [Apple Documentation] - Period
* [Cocoapods] - Official website for this great dependency manager tool, you can find all the details of the Cocoa Pod you are about to implement in your project.
* [Cocoa Controls] - Do you want to start a new iOS project and you just need and idea for that amazing custom view, well this is the right place.
* [Objectivec2Swift] - Why would you struggle with porting that Obj-C block when you can have a website giving you a nice Swift closure back.
* [MakeAppIcon] - Are you at the middle of a Hackaton and you donâ€™t a tool like Sketch available ?  this website will give you all the app icons for your iOS or Android project.
