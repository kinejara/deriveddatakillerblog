Honestly there are a bunch of reasons why I decided to start this blog:  
  1. I wanted to learn and practice Markdown, I’m currently using Hexo a blog framework powered by Node.js that supports Markdown.
  2. A spare Raspberry Pi 3 that I could use as a WebServer.
  3. Improving my written english.

### Why deriveddatakiller.com ?

This is just a joke among iOS Developers, Derived data is a folder that contains intermediate  build information and your project’s index information, indexing issues are a pain in XCode  this still the case even in the latest version of XCode 8, as a “surgical strike” killing or  removing all the content inside of the Derived Data folder is the solution for a lot of this  problems.
