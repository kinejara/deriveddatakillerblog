Even when you feel that the Mobile apps boom was just a few years ago it's always good to take a glance to the past  
and contemplate how the UI and UX used to be in the past, one tool that you can sure use in order to figure out what is going to be the next UI trend is this website 
called [Great Apps Timeline], here you can appreciate the evolution of some of the most populat apps like Instagram, Uber and WhatsApp, this last one will surprise you since it's clearly prove that simplicity has been there since the beginning.

The only downside of this website is that apparently it's only showing the UI timeline of iOS app.
